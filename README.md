# Weather Forecast Project

## Overview

The Weather Forecast Project provides real-time weather information to users, allowing them to check weather forecasts based on location. This project integrates multiple technologies for both front-end and back-end functionalities, including a user-friendly interface built with React and data retrieval powered by Java technologies and MongoDB.

### Key Features

- **Real-time weather data**: Users can view current weather conditions and forecasts for any city.
- **Search functionality**: Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- **Responsive design**: The application is mobile-friendly, providing a seamless experience across devices.
- **Backend services**: The backend leverages Spring Boot and JDBC to handle API requests, with Hibernate managing interactions with the database.
- **Database**: MongoDB stores user preferences and weather data logs.
- **AJAX**: Used for asynchronous data fetching to ensure smooth user interaction without page reloads.
